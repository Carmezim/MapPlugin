### Google maps plugin in JS. 

The app to which this plugin was requested to be built for already faced serious performance issues
therefore it had to be optimized at its maximum. However the requested features for this plugin were per se at the same time anti-patterns for decent performance such as quickly rendering thousands (or even tens of thousands) of data points in real time on a list dynamically updated according to user input on the map. 
I managed however to obtain incredible results optimizing the plugin with efficient and elegant solutions code-wise and well designed architecture. The result was a success yielding a really fast performing app with all features and requests implemented despite the pre-existing challenges with performance.
