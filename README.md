### Map plugin

The app to which this plugin was requested to be built for already faced serious performance issues
therefore it had to be well optimized. The requested features for this plugin were per se also anti-patterns for reasonable performance such as quickly rendering thousands (or tens of thousands) of data points in real time on a list dynamically updated according to user input on the map. 
I managed however to obtain incredible results optimizing the plugin with efficient and elegant solutions code-wise, well chosen stack/tools and nicely designed architecture. The result was a success yielding a really fast performing app with well structured API end-points despite the pre-existing challenges with performance.
